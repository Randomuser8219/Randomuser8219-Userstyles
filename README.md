# Randomuser8219's Userstyles
This is where I make WIP userstyles and push beta versions of my styles. Release versions of my styles can be found on https://userstyles.world/user/ArbestRi02.
# Themes as of now
1. 2016 Tweaks for V3 + StarTube: Makes StarTube and V3 more faithful to 2016 by changing icons, colors, pages and more.
3. Material Search Bar for V3: The 2016 material search bar experiement from YouTube, brought into V3.
4. Skeumorphic Theme for V3: I don't work on it anymore. It's more like gradients everywhere than skeumorphism.
5. Update DownDetector Logos: Updates the plenty of outdated logos on DownDetector's home page. Images are from Logopedia.
6. Glass Masthead and Guide for V3: Adds blur effects to V3's search box, masthead and guide.
7. Early 2013 Playlists for V3: don't use this one. there's already something with the same name by someone else which came out earlier.
8. Dark Mode for 2016 StarTube Tweaks: Adds dark mode support to 2016 Tweaks for StarTube.
9. Discord Refresh Better Text Form: Makes the Discord UI refresh text form aligned with the user info on the left of the form.
10. Skeuomorphic Theme for V3 + StarTube 2016: Take 2 of a skeuomorphic theme, this time not sticking to the same gradient everywhere.
11. Pre-Late 2023 YT Amsterdam Improvements: Improves upon Magma_Craft's pre-late 2023 YouTube Amsterdam layout userstyle.
12. Odytube: Makes Odysee look like modern YouTube. Heavy WIP
